# Heart_disease_detection
Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various health parameters. Early detection of heart disease is critical for effective treatment and prevention. By leveraging medical data and machine learning algorithms, this model provides a reliable way to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing heart disease.

**Features**
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Multiple classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Visualization of data and model results
User-friendly interface for inputting patient data and getting predictions (optional)

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is the Heart Disease UCI dataset
, which contains various medical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

**Technologies Used**
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook (for exploration and model building)
Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-detection.git
cd heart-disease-detection


Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Prepare the dataset (if needed) or use the provided preprocessed data.
Run the training script to train the model:
python train_model.py



**Model Evaluation**

The model is evaluated using:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
ROC-AUC Curve

**Results
**
The Random Forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy of X% on the test set, demonstrating good predictive capability for heart disease diagnosis.

Future Work
Incorporate more advanced models like XGBoost or deep learning.
Deploy the model as a web application or API.
Use larger and more diverse datasets.
Improve feature engineering and selection.
